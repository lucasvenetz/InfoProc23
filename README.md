“Slash Man” is a real-time multiplayer game where two players can engage in a duel using TCP/UDP connection architecture. The system uses two FPGA-based controller nodes, translating physical movements into in-game sword manoeuvres and player movement. Players must balance their stamina while depleting their opponent’s health. The system also incorporates a persistent leaderboard mechanism that tracks player performance across multiple game sessions and records the highest individual kills/scores.
